UberChef is a not intended to function as a business but fully functional nonetheless, UberChef is a Rails 4.0 application that allows users to hire professional chefs in their area. The app uses Devise for authentication and was developed using PostgreSQL as the database and tested with Capybara and RSpec.

Back Story:
I was a professional chef in my past life and I would occasionally find myself with some free time. I wanted to be able to connect with people looking for a chef to work on small scale culinary projects like teaching a cooking class for friends at home, or just someone needing help putting meals in the fridge. I envisioned an app that an average person could easily use to post an event they needed help with, including some details such as a description and how much they wanted to spend. At the same time, I wanted an app that allowed a professional chef to easily browse and search events that fit their time and location requirements. The app allows the chef to bid on events created by other users. I created an easy-to-use interface that allows a user to see the events that they have created, the bids that have been made on each of their events, and the events they have bid on, if applicable. After a userâ€™s event receives a bid, they have access to the chef that bid on the event. They can read the details of the bid, find out more about the chef and, if they like what they see, they can contact the chef via a simple messaging feature to hash out the details.
